# hello-world

Hi everyone!

I'm Kayla, a digital media student and independent artist who is learning about coding and computer science. I gained interest in computer science during my senior year of high school, when I took a computer science 1 course (shoutout to class of 2021). I'm eager to learn and gain more experience with other languages!

Fun Facts: I'm a sucker for Pixar films, I am allergic to avocados, and I enjoy random adventures!
